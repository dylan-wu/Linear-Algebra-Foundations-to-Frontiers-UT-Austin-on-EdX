# 1.2 What is a Vector

```
At 1:16, a slide has the following:

The symbols i and j denote *e_0*, *e_1* and *e_2* in 2D and 3D; and
The symbol k denotes *e_2* in 3D
Removing *e_2* in the first line would make this slide more correct.  (Fixing videos is painful, so this notification will have to do.)

Also, at 00:32 Robert says *e_0* instead of *e_j*
